Jarvis is an autonomous "Active Defense" agent designed to proactively detect and neutralize network threats in real-time. Built with Python, it operates as a modular system where the Monitor sniffs live packets and maps them to local processes, the Detector cross-references traffic against global threat intelligence feeds (like Tor Exit Nodes), and the Firewall orchestrates OS-level blocks (via netsh or iptables) to sever malicious connections instantly. Featuring a built-in honeypot for decoy detection and multi-threaded architecture, Jarvis serves as an educational framework for understanding how automated Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools defend against modern cyberattacks—use with caution, as it actively modifies system firewall rules.
